## Housing prices Prediction In King County
## Problem Statement
The Real estate agency face difficulties, when accessing the key factors tha influence the housing prices in King County.Then aim of this project is try to find the most important features that influence ,the housing prices . We also aim to provide the most to develop a more comprehensive understanding of our variables so us to predict accurately the housing prices in king count

## Project Overview
The project focuses on multiple linear regression model for prediction of housing prices for our Real Estate agency

## Business understanding
Trying to predict the housing prices for our real estate agency is very crucial task.Accurately Prediction we help our Real Estate Agency to draw insights on the features that effect the price and try to implemenent to see if they can increase the market value of the houses.

## Components
. ##Jupyter notebook : The [Jupyter notebook] The notebook shows the approach and ways in which we did our analysis.ie data cleaning,exploratory data analysis and modeling

.##Presentation .The [Presentions]. THis briefly explains the slides ,to explain to our findings to the real estate agency.

## Data
THe dataset was from "kc_house_data.csv"

## Libraries/Packages Used
Python Matplotlib Seaborn Pandas Statsmodel Scikit-learn

To get Started
1 Clone the Repository 2 Data can be found in the file kc_house_data

## Data Wrangling
We worked on missing values, feature engineering, dealing with duplicates,.This helps a clean data for accurately prediction for our housing prices.

## EXploratorty Data Analysis
Here we will explore the different features of the dataset to gain a better understanding of the data. We will use data vizualization to uncover trends and patterns. We will use Feature Engineering to create new features from existing ones and perform One-Hot Encoding on categorical variables that we will require for analysis.

Most houses are priced around a half million to a million dollars, while the most expensive houses imply the order of two million dollars and more

## Overview of house features
Categorical features of the house include id, date, bedrooms, floors, waterfront, view, grade, year_built, yr_renovetd, zipcode, lat, long. Numerical variables include price, sqft_living, sqft_lot, sqft_above, sqft_basement, sqft_basement, sqft_living_above, sqft_lot_below. it is can be noticed that as bedrooms increase, so does the house's selling price more floors, preferably up to 2.5 have a higher price.

This model has a weak predictive capability.

Multiple Linear regression

90.4%

$71,295

## The model has a strong predictive capability.

## Conclusions
The real estate market is dynamic and complex

There is a need for a robust model that predicts the prices of the houses

We developed a regression model to explain the relationship between house prices and other variables

The Real Estate Agency should consider investing in houses with a nice view, large basement, and waterfront
